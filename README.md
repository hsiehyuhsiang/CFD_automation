# CFD_automation

School project for automating CFD workflows:  
mesh generation → simulation → post-processing

## Overview

This project aims to automate a basic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) workflow,
including mesh generation, solver execution, and post-processing.

The goal is to reduce manual intervention and improve reproducibility for CFD simulations
in a school project setting.

## Workflow

The automated workflow follows these steps:

1. Mesh generation  
2. CFD simulation  
3. Post-processing and result extraction
